| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                         I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Oct 28  | 11:00-11:50am | I spent this time working on the buildTable function, specifically gathering each key, value, and then hashing the key using Horner's method. Next I will work on building out the table i will use (an array of ArrayLists) for the fast lookups. |
| Oct 30  |  8:50-9:30am  |                                             I spent this time continuing to write my code, building out the table as stated above. I wrote two hash methods, one for a hash with a max p value of 10,000 and one closer to the max size of a long. |
| Oct 31  |  5:00-5:30pm  |                                                                           I spent this time debugging. I had to better think out how to code my while loop for br.readLine, and determined that I had to call readline at the end of the function. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
