Next I will work on building out the table i will use (an array of ArrayLists) for the fast lookups. |

I wrote two hash methods, one for a hash with a max p value of 10,000 and one closer to the max size of a long. |

I had to better think out how to code my while loop for br.readLine, and determined that I had to call readline at the end of the function. |
| Nov 3   | 5:30pm-6:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I spent this time beginning to code my HashMap function, adding the functions for add, get, and resize as written in the theory slide. I made sure to keep track of elements and tablesize, and if alpha exceeded 0.5, that i would resize the table. Next, I need to figure out how to resize (loop through element in an arraylist?). |
| Nov 5   |  9:20-9:50am  | I spent this time coding resize. After talking with Mr. Blick, I realized i could use a different arraylist to keep track of each of my elements, but it would still be categorically the same. That's why for now I looped through each element in the array and if something existed there, I would reHash its key and value and move it to the new array I created of double the size. Importantly, I can't just pre-emptively add it to the new arraylist, I first need to keep increasing the index of the new hashed value until I get to an empty location. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
